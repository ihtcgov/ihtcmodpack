This is the official Modpack of I Hate Texas City.
_Everything GitHub-related will be released to the official GitHub @ihtcmodpack account._

* One point to remember, even if you want the old version of the modpack, you can still download it from the latest release of this year because we keep every release in the zip file of that year _(from December to November basically.)_

* How to install: [Wikipage:How to install the modpack](https://github.com/ihtcgov/ihtcmodpack/wiki/How-to-install-the-modpack)
